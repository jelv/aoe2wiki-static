								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello world. I&#8217;m Jelv from the Netherlands. Welcome on aoe2.wiki. It has been three years since a friend introduced me to Age of Empires II HD and I&#8217;ve been hooked ever since. First playing against friends, then against players from the <a href="https://gathering.tweakers.net/forum/list_messages/1645628/0">Gathering of Tweakers</a> (Dutch), later even some small tournaments and the a few lan parties. This site is my little side project to give back to the aoe2 community that I&#8217;ve enjoyed the last few years. And it&#8217;s a good change for me to improve my development skills.</p>
<p>The plan is to built a definitive edition Age of Empires 2 Wiki. First as beta in English and when it&#8217;s stable enough also in other languages like Dutch.</p>
<p>Currently there is high quality information scattered all over the social networks, forums and sites of the community. There are great topics on <a href="http://www.aoczone.net/viewtopic.php?p=38843">AoCZone</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/">/r/aoe2</a>, there is <a href="http://aoe2stats.net/">aoe2stats.net</a>, Voobly&#8217;s <a href="https://aoc.voobly.com/display/aoc">AoC Knowledge Base</a>, the Steam Community, <a href="http://aok.heavengames.com/university">AoK University</a> and Jineapple&#8217;s <a href="http://aochub.com/csj/">AoC Cheat Sheet</a>. The big aoe wiki, <a href="http://ageofempires.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Civilizations_(Age_of_Empires_II)">Wikia</a>, ties some of this information together, but it&#8217;s full with advertisment and trackers. That just leaves me with bad taste in my mouth. My view is that a healthy community should be funded by it&#8217;s own people and not by selling it&#8217;s attention. Just like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/escapeaoe">EscapeAoE</a> I want aoe2.wiki to be crowdfunded.</p>
<p>So my plan is to built an crowdsourced and crowdfunded up-to-date wiki focused on Age of Empires 2. I&#8217;ve setup <a href="https://liberapay.com/aoe2wiki/">Liberapay</a> for the crowdfunding. The current hosting and domain cost are just €1,06 a week. During the beta I will cover the costs, but the community should step up when the site launches. For now there is not really a timeline. I will just donate the time that I got and see how quick it all goes. At this moment I&#8217;m looking into MediaWiki, it&#8217;s extentions and a good version control system.</p>
<p>If you have any question about the aoe2.wiki, please leave a comment below or shoot a message on our <a href="https://mastodon.nl/@aoe2wiki">Mastodon</a> channel.</p>
